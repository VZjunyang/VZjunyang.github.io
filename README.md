# Minimal Squarespace‑Style Photography Portfolio

A clean, static portfolio you can host for free on GitHub Pages. Replace images and text, push, and you're live.

## Files
- `index.html` – main page
- `styles.css` – minimalist styling
- `images/hero.jpg` – hero background (replace with your own)
- `images/placeholder.jpg` – sample thumbnail (replace with your own)
- `.nojekyll` – disables Jekyll processing to serve any filenames as-is

## Quick Start
1. Replace images under `/images/` with your own.
2. Edit text in `index.html` (name, about, socials).
3. Commit and push to your repo (user.github.io or project repo).
